            The <span class="chicken"><b>chicken</b></span> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of
            the
            red
            junglefowl originally from
            Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
            cockerel. A
            male that has been castrated is a capon.
            An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
            Hellenistic
            period <sup><a href="about.html">(4th–2nd centuries BC)</a></sup>.
            [1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as
            pets.

            Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of
            2018,[3] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[4] There are more chickens in the world than any other
            bird.[4]
            There
            are
            numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5]
            but
            the
            clade
            found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From
            ancient
            India,
            the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl have been
            known
            in
            Egypt
            since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between
            Syria
            and
            Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]
